<p>
Khepri is a tree-like replicated on-disk database library for Erlang and
Elixir.</p>

<p>Data are stored in a <strong>tree structure</strong>. Each node in the tree is
referenced by its path from the root node. A path is a list of Erlang atoms
and/or binaries. For ease of use, Unix-like path strings are accepted as well.</p>

<p>For <strong>consistency and replication</strong> and to manage data on disk,
Khepri relies on <a href="https://github.com/rabbitmq/ra">Ra</a>, an Erlang
implementation of the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus
algorithm</a>. In Ra parlance, Khepri is a state machine in a Ra cluster.</p>

<p>This page <strong>describes all the concepts in Khepri</strong> and points the
reader to the modules' documentation for more details.</p>

<h3><a name="Why_Khepri?">Why Khepri?</a></h3>

<p>This started as an experiment to replace how data other than message bodies are
stored in the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ messaging
broker</a>. Before Khepri, those data were stored and replicated to cluster
members using Mnesia.</p>

Mnesia is very handy and powerful:
<ul>
<li>It comes out-of-the-box with the Erlang runtime and standard library.</li>
<li>It does all the heavy lifting and RabbitMQ just uses it as a key/value
store without thinking too much about replication.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, recovering from any network partitions is quite difficult. This was
the primary reason why the RabbitMQ team started to explore other options.</p>

<p>Because RabbitMQ already uses an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm
for its quorum queues, it was decided to leverage that library for all
metadata. That's how Khepri was borned.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ra and Raft, it is <strong>clear how Khepri will behave during and
recover from a network partition</strong>. This makes it more comfortable for
the RabbitMQ team and users, thanks to the absence of unknowns.</p>

<blockquote>
At the time of this writing, RabbitMQ does not use Khepri in a production
release yet because this library and its integration into RabbitMQ are still a
work in progress.

<h3><a name="The_tree_structure">The tree structure</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Tree_nodes">Tree nodes</a></h4>

Data in Khepri are organized as <em>tree nodes</em> (<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_machine#tree_node/0" href="khepri_machine.html#type-tree_node"><code>khepri_machine:tree_node()</code></a>) in a tree structure. Every tree nodes have:
<ul>
<li>a <a href="#Node_ID">node ID</a></li>
<li>a <a href="#Payload">payload</a> (optional)</li>
<li><a href="#Properties">properties</a></li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-none">o
|
+-- orders
|
`-- stock
    |
    `-- wood
        |-- &lt;&lt;"mapple"&gt;&gt; = 12
        `-- &lt;&lt;"oak"&gt;&gt; = 41</code></pre>

<h4><a name="Node_ID">Node ID</a></h4>

<p>A tree node name is either an Erlang atom or an Erlang binary (<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_path#node_id/0" href="khepri_path.html#type-node_id"><code>khepri_path:node_id()</code></a>).</p>

<h4><a name="Payload">Payload</a></h4>

<p>A tree node may or may not have a payload. Khepri currently supports a single
type of payload, the <em>data payload</em>. More payload types may be added in
the future.</p>

Payloads are represented using macros or helper functions:
<ul>
<li><code>none</code> and <a docgen-rel="seemfa" docgen-href="khepri#no_payload/0" href="khepri.html#no_payload-0"><code>khepri:no_payload/0</code></a></li>
<li><code>#kpayload_data{data = Term}</code> and <a docgen-rel="seemfa" docgen-href="khepri#data_payload/1" href="khepri.html#data_payload-1"><code>khepri:data_payload/1</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>Functions in <a docgen-rel="seeerl" docgen-href="khepri_machine" href="khepri_machine.html"><code>khepri_machine</code></a> have no assumption on the type of the
payload because they are a low-level API. Therefore, it must be specified
explicitly using the macros or helper functions mentionned above.</p>

<p>Most functions in <a docgen-rel="seeerl" docgen-href="khepri" href="khepri.html"><code>khepri</code></a>, being a higher-level API, target more
specific use cases and assume a particular type of payload.</p>

<h4><a name="Properties">Properties</a></h4>

Properties are:
<ul>
<li>The version of the payload, tracking the number of times it was modified
(<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_machine#payload_version/0" href="khepri_machine.html#type-payload_version"><code>khepri_machine:payload_version()</code></a>).</li>
<li>The version of the list of child nodes, tracking the number of times child
nodes were added or removed (<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_machine#child_list_version/0" href="khepri_machine.html#type-child_list_version"><code>khepri_machine:child_list_version()</code></a>).</li>
<li>The number of child nodes (<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_machine#child_list_count/0" href="khepri_machine.html#type-child_list_count"><code>khepri_machine:child_list_count()</code></a>).</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Addressing_a_tree_node">Addressing a tree node</a></h4>

<p>The equivalent of a <em>key</em> in a key/value store is a <em>path</em>
(<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_path#path/0" href="khepri_path.html#type-path"><code>khepri_path:path()</code></a>) in Khepri.</p>

A path is a list of node IDs, from the root (unnamed) tree node to the target
(<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_path#path/0" href="khepri_path.html#type-path"><code>khepri_path:path()</code></a>). For instance:
<pre><code>%% Points to "/stock/wood/oak" in the tree showed above:
Path = [stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"oak"&gt;&gt;].</code></pre>

It is possible to target multiple tree nodes at once by using a <em>path
pattern</em> (<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_path#pattern/0" href="khepri_path.html#type-pattern"><code>khepri_path:pattern()</code></a>). In addition to node IDs, path
patterns have conditions (<a docgen-rel="seetype" docgen-href="khepri_condition#condition/0" href="khepri_condition.html#type-condition"><code>khepri_condition:condition()</code></a>). Conditions allow things like:
<ul>
<li>checking the existence of a tree node</li>
<li>targetting all child nodes of a tree node</li>
<li>matching on node IDs using a regex</li>
<li>matching on the data payload</li>
</ul>

For instance:
<pre><code>%% Matches all varieties of wood in the stock:
PathPattern = [stock, wood, #if_node_matches{regex = any}].

%% Matches the supplied of oak if there is an active order:
PathPattern = [order,
               wood,
               #if_all{conditions = [
                 &lt;&lt;"oak"&gt;&gt;,
                 #if_data_matches{pattern = {active, true}}]},
               supplier].</code></pre>

Finally, a path can use some special path component names, handy when using
relative paths:
<ul>
<li><code>?THIS_NODE</code> to point to self</li>
<li><code>?PARENT_NODE</code> to point to the parent tree node</li>
<li><code>?ROOT_NODE</code> to explicitly point to the root unnamed node</li>
</ul>

<p>Relative paths are useful when putting conditions on
<a href="#Tree_node_lifetime">tree node lifetimes</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Tree_node_lifetime">Tree node lifetime</a></h4>

<p>A tree node's lifetime starts when it is inserted the first time, until it is
removed from the tree. However, intermediary tree nodes created on the way
remain in the tree long after the leaf node was removed.</p>

<p>For instance, when <code>[stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"walnut"&gt;&gt;]</code> was inserted, the intermediary
tree nodes <code>stock</code> and <code>wood</code> were created if they were missing. After
<code>&lt;&lt;"walnut"&gt;&gt;</code> is removed, they will stay in the tree with possibly neither
payload nor child nodes.</p>

<p>Khepri has the concept of <em><code>keep_while</code> conditions</em>. A <code>keep_while</code>
condition is like the conditions which can be used inside path pattern. When a
node is inserted or updated, it is possible to set <code>keep_while</code> conditions:
when these conditions evaluate to false, the tree node is removed from the
tree.</p>

For instance, it is possible to set the following condition on <code>[stock, wood]</code>
to make sure it is removed after its last child node is removed:
<pre><code>%% We keep [stock, wood] as long as its child nodes count is strictly greater
%% than zero.
KeepWhileCondition = #{[stock, wood] =&gt; #if_child_list_length{count = {gt, 0}}}.</code></pre>

<p><code>keep_while</code> conditions on self (like the example above) are not evaluated on
the first insert though.</p>

<h3><a name="Khepri_API">Khepri API</a></h3>

<h4><a name="High-level_API">High-level API</a></h4>

<p>A high-level API is provided by the <a docgen-rel="seeerl" docgen-href="khepri" href="khepri.html"><code>khepri</code></a> module. It covers most
common use cases and should be straightforward to use.</p>

<pre><code>khepri:insert([stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;], 150),

Ret = khepri:get([stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;]),
{ok, #{[stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;] =&gt;
       #{child_list_count =&gt; 0,
         child_list_version =&gt; 1,
         data =&gt; 150,
         payload_version =&gt; 1}}} = Ret,

true = khepri:exists([stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;]),

khepri:delete([stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;]).</code></pre>

<h4><a name="Low-level_API">Low-level API</a></h4>

<p>The high-level API is built on top of a low-level API. The low-level API is
provided by the <a docgen-rel="seeerl" docgen-href="khepri_machine" href="khepri_machine.html"><code>khepri_machine</code></a> module.</p>

<p>The low-level API provides just a handful of primitives. More advanced or
specific use cases may need to rely on that low-level API.</p>

<pre><code>%% Unlike the high-level API's `khepri:insert/2' function, this low-level %
%% insert returns whatever it replaced (if anything). In this case, there was
%% nothing before, so the returned value is pretty empty.
Ret1 = khepri_machine:put(
         StoreId, [stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;],
         #kpayload_data{data = 150}),
{ok, #{}} = Ret1,

Ret2 = khepri_machine:get(StoreId, [stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;]),
{ok, #{[stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;] =&gt;
       #{child_list_count =&gt; 0,
         child_list_version =&gt; 1,
         data =&gt; 150,
         payload_version =&gt; 1}}} = Ret2,

%% Unlike the high-level API's `khepri:delete/2' function, this low-level
%% delete returns whatever it deleted.
Ret3 = khepri_machine:delete(StoreId, [stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;]),
{ok, #{[stock, wood, &lt;&lt;"lime tree"&gt;&gt;] =&gt;
       #{child_list_count =&gt; 0,
         child_list_version =&gt; 1,
         data =&gt; 150,
         payload_version =&gt; 1}}} = Ret3.</code></pre>

<h4><a name="Stores">Stores</a></h4>

<p>It is possible to have multiple database instances running on the same node or
cluster.</p>

<p>By default, Khepri starts a default store, based on Ra's default system.</p>

<h3><a name="Transactions">Transactions</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>

<p>On the surface, Khepri transactions look like Mnesia ones: they are anonymous
functions which can do any arbitrary operations on the data and return any
result. If something goes wrong or the anonymous function aborts, nothing is
committed and the database is left untouched as if the transaction code was
never called.</p>

Under the hood, there are several restrictions and caveats that need to be
understood in order to use transactions in Khepri:
<ul>
<li>If the anonymous function only <strong>reads data</strong> from the tree,
there is no specific restrictions on them.</li>
<li>If however the anonymous function needs to <strong>modify or
delete</strong> data from the database, then the constraints described in the
next section need to be taken into account.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nature of the anonymous function is passed as the <code>ReadWrite</code> argument to
<a docgen-rel="seemfa" docgen-href="khepri#transaction/3" href="khepri.html#transaction-3"><code>khepri:transaction/3</code></a> or <a docgen-rel="seemfa" docgen-href="khepri_machine#transaction/3" href="khepri_machine.html#transaction-3"><code>khepri_machine:transaction/3</code></a>
functions.</p>

<h4><a name="The_constraints_imposed_by_Raft">The constraints imposed by Raft</a></h4>

<p>The Raft algorithm is used to achieve consensus among Khepri members
participating in the database. Khepri is a state machine executed on each Ra
node and all instances of that Khepri state machine start with the same state
and modify it identically. The goal is that, after the same list of Ra
commands, all instances have the same state.</p>

<p>When a new Ra node joins the cluster and therefore participates to the Khepri
database, it starts a new Khepri state machine instance. This instance needs to
apply all Ra commands from an initial state to be on the same page as other
existing instances.</p>

<p>Likewise, if for any reason, one of the Khepri state machine instance looses
the connection to other members and can't apply Ra commands, then the link
comes back, it has to catch up.</p>

<p>All this means that the code to modify the state of the state machines (i.e.
the tree) needs to run on all instances, possibly not a the same time, and give
the exact same result everywhere.</p>

<h4><a name="The_problem_with_anonymous_functions">The problem with anonymous functions</a></h4>

This is fine for inserts and deletes because the code is part of Khepri and is
deterministic. This poses a problem when transactions are anonymous functions
outside of Khepri's control:
<ol>
<li>Khepri must be able to store the anonymous function as a Ra command in Ra's
log. This is the basis for replication and is mandatory to add a new cluster
member or for a lagging member to catch up.</li>
<li>The anonymous function must produce exactly the same result in all state
machine instances, regardless of the time it runs, the availability of other
Erlang modules, the state of Erlang processes, files on disk or network
connections, and so on.</li>
</ol>

<p>To achieve that, <a docgen-rel="seeerl" docgen-href="khepri_fun" href="khepri_fun.html"><code>khepri_fun</code></a> and <a docgen-rel="seeerl" docgen-href="khepri_tx" href="khepri_tx.html"><code>khepri_tx</code></a> extract the assembly
code of the anonymous function and create a standalone Erlang module based on
it. This module can be stored in Ra's log and executed anywhere without the
presence of the initial anonymous function's module.</p>

Here is what they do in more details:
<ol>
<li>The assembly code of the module hosting the anonymous function is extracted</li>
<li>The anynmous function code is located inside that assembly code</li>
<li>The code is analyzed to determine:
<ul>
<li>that it does not perform any forbidden operations (sending or receving
inter-process messages, use date and time, access files or network connections,
etc.)</li>
<li>what other functions it calls</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Based on the listed function calls, the same steps are repeated for all of
them (extract, verify, list calls)</li>
<li>Once all the assembly code to have a standalone anonymous function is
collected, an Erlang module is generated based</li>
</ol>
